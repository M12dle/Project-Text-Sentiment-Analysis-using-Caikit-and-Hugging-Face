# Natural Language Processing with Hugging Face Transformers
## Author : Cognitive Class AI

# Overview
Caikit is an AI toolkit that enables you to use and manage AI models through a set of developer-friendly APIs. It provides a consistent format for creating and using AI models across a wide variety of data domains and tasks. Similar to how, in cloud computing, users can deploy applications to the cloud without a detailed understanding of the underlying infrastructure, Caikit handles many of the infrastructure concerns of serving and using AI models. With Caikit, developers who write applications that use AI models aren鴠beholden to understanding the low-level details of how those models work.
Caikit鳠purpose is twofold. Not only is it meant to facilitate AI model management by making it easier to train and maintain your models, but it also facilitates AI model users頥xperience, making it possible to tap into models through familiar APIs (for example, Inference) with no need to transform data.
Simply put, Caikit streamlines AI model management and makes it easy for you to implement AI models into your apps, allowing you to focus on new development instead of maintenance.
